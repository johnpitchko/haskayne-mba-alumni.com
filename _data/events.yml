      Thank you for attending our 2017 ‘Ugly Christmas Sweater & Ugly Christmas Tie Party’. We had a great turnout despite freezing weather! We were thrilled to eat, drink and be tacky with all of you. The selection of ugly sweaters and ties was very impressive. We are excited to share that Jon Hartwick and Vikrant Kushawa won the awards for the most horrid and tacky attire. Congratulations!

      On behalf of Haskayne MBA Alumni Alliance, we want to wish you festive and restful holiday season, and we hope that you join us for many more events in the New Year 2018.
